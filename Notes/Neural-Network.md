- Brains are made up of neurons connected via synapses
- Synapses carry electric and chemical signals between neurons
- Neurons decide whether to go ahead or stop the signal


## Feed Forward Neural Network
FNNs work by accepting some numbers at their input and propagating (feedforwarding) those numbers layer-by-layer across the entire network; numbers that appear at the last layer determine network's answer. 

### Bias
Bias is a parameter that controls the threshold for neuron activation. It allows the neuron to fire even if the sum of its inputs is below the threshold.
